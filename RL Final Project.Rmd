## Overview
This is Coursera’s Practical Machine Learning course Final Project Report.

    * We will use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of six participants in this experiment to forecast how they will perform the workout. In the training set, this is the “classe” variable. We have four models that we train: On the training set, k-folds cross validation was used to test Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, and Support Vector Machine. The accuracy and out of sample error rate are then calculated using a validation set randomly selected from the training csv data. We choose the best model based on those data and apply it to forecast 20 cases using the test csv set. 

## Background
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: (http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har) (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

The training data for this project are available here:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv

The test data are available here:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv

The data for this project come from this source: http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment.


## Environment preparation, install required packages
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(lattice)
library(caret)  
library(kernlab)
library(rattle)
library(randomForest)  
library(corrplot) 
library(Amelia)
library(datasets)
library(caTools)
library(party)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(xgboost)
```

## Load Data and remove #DIV/0 and NA elements
```{r}
train <- read.csv("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv", 
                          na.strings=c('#DIV/0', '', 'NA') ,stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
test <- read.csv("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv",
                          na.strings= c('#DIV/0', '', 'NA'),stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
dim(train)
dim(test)
```
#### Keep original datasets
```{r}
train1 <- train
test1 <- test
```

#### Check for missing values and zero variance predictors
```{r}
missmap(train, main = "Missing values map - train")
```

#### 1) Remove NA elements
```{r}
rmNA <- (colSums(is.na(train1)) == 0)
train1 <- train1[, rmNA]
dim(train1)
```

#### 2) Remove Near Zero Variables - NZV
```{r}
nzv <- nearZeroVar(train1)
train1 <- train1[,-nzv]
dim(train1)
```

#### 3) Remove columns with variables not relevant to the study
```{r}
train1 <- train1[,-c(1:7)]
dim(train1)
```

### Create and validate the models
Split the clean train1 dataset 70/30 into training and validating datasets. 
The test1 dataset will not be used. The model will be applied to the final quiz 
exercises.  
```{r}
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=train1$classe, p=0.7, list=FALSE)
trainMod <- train1[inTrain,]
validMod <- train1[-inTrain,]
```

We will test several models, namely Decision Trees, Random Forests, 
Gradient Boosted Trees and Support Vector Machine.
We will use a 3-fold cross validation control with the training model.

```{r}
control <- trainControl(method="cv", number=3, verboseIter=FALSE)
```

### 1. Decision Tree
```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.heigth = 6.7}
decTree <- train(classe~., data=trainMod, method="rpart", trControl = control, tuneLength = 5)
fancyRpartPlot(decTree$finalModel)
```

```{r}
treePred <- predict(decTree, validMod)
conf_trees <- confusionMatrix(treePred, factor(validMod$classe))
conf_trees
```

### 2. Random Forest
```{r}
rfMod <- train(classe~., data=trainMod, method="rf", trControl = control, tuneLength = 5)
rfPred <- predict(rfMod, validMod)
rfConf <- confusionMatrix(rfPred, factor(validMod$classe))
rfConf
```

### 3. Gradient Boosted Trees - GBM
```{r}
gbmMod <- train(classe~., data=trainMod, method="gbm", trControl = control, tuneLength = 5, verbose = FALSE)
gbmPred <- predict(gbmMod, validMod)
gbmConf <- confusionMatrix(gbmPred, factor(validMod$classe))
gbmConf
```


### 4. Support Vector Machine - SVM
```{r}
svmMod <- train(classe~., data=trainMod, method="svmLinear", trControl = control, tuneLength = 5, verbose = FALSE)
svmPred <- predict(svmMod, validMod)
svmConf <- confusionMatrix(svmPred, factor(validMod$classe))
svmConf
```

### Accuracy Results

| Model | Accuracy |
|:-----:|:--------:|
|RF     | 0.9947   |
|GBM    | 0.9922   |
|SVM    | 0.7721   |
|Tree   | 0.5601   |

## Prediction on test set 
Random Forest returned the best results with 0.9929 accuracy so we will use it
to predict the outcome on the original test set = 'test'.
```{r}
rfPred <- predict(rfMod, test)
rfPred
```

Plot the Models
```{r}
plot(decTree)
```

```{r}
plot(rfMod)
```



```{r}
plot(gbmMod)
```
